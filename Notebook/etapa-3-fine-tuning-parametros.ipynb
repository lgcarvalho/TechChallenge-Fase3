Woe be to anyone who views the four very diverse and remarkable Christmas dinner dishes here on an empty stomach: nothing will taste nearly as exciting. British chef Anne Willan drops by Stewart's kitchen to make a hearty, standing rib roast with accompanying Yorkshire pudding&#x97;foods she grew up eating in the farm country north of York. Chef Mario Batali, an expert on foods of Southern Italy, does two segments, one resulting in a fantastic seafood salad (with lobster, calamari, mussels, peppers, and more) and the other an impossibly beautiful baccala ravioli, using fresh-made pasta pillows filled with a mix of baccala and riced potatoes, tossed in Batali's red sauce with a hint of mint. Finally, chef Dan Silverman demonstrates how to remove pomegranate seeds from the fruit without too much hassle, and then add those seeds to an astonishing duck dish.Playful and dazzling desserts include meringue mushrooms, which look just like the real thing, and a Birch de Noel made of chocolate and cream, laid out like a Yuletide log. Household decorating hints are both clever and simple, including the strategic placing of colorful bowls of fruits and candies on shelves, and the embellishing of homemade wreaths with colorful balls (small, pink ones from Japan are oddly magical), candy, and popcorn. A section on Hanukkah gifts and foods includes a nice idea for filling embossed bags with candies, and a variation on traditional potato pancakes that includes adding strips of carrots and parsnips. Suggestions for making gifts and wrapping round out this very pleasant disc.--Tom Keogh\", \"Card Games for Dummiesbills itself as &quot;the fun and easy way  to play and win your favorite card games.&quot; The book is broken down into  different sections that broadly encompass the types of card games available: card-swapping  games (gin and rummy), trick-taking games (whist and euchre), games where you try to score as many points as possible (pinochle), and games where you don't want to score any points at all (hearts). Each chapter starts with the fundamentals--the definition of a &quot;trick,&quot; for example--and builds from there, progressing from the simplest games in each category to the more complex.Written by journalist Barry Rigal,Card Games for Dummiesis a nice companion piece to the more staidComplete Hoyle's Games. UnlikeHoyle's,Card Games for Dummiesnot only explains game mechanics, but gives you useful tips for play, provides the lowdown on strategy, and warns of the boneheaded blunders that you'd undoubtedly make if you'd been taught the rules and nothing more.So if you've always wanted to learn cribbage, but never wanted to ask a friend for a tutorial, this is the book for you.

Woe be to anyone who views the four very diverse and remarkable Christmas dinner dishes here on an empty stomach: nothing will taste nearly as exciting. British chef Anne Willan drops by Stewart's kitchen to make a hearty, standing rib roast with accompanying Yorkshire pudding&#x97;foods she grew up eating in the farm country north of York. Chef Mario Batali, an expert on foods of Southern Italy, does two segments, one resulting in a fantastic seafood salad (with lobster, calamari, mussels, peppers, and more) and the other an impossibly beautiful baccala ravioli, using fresh-made pasta pillows filled with a mix of baccala and riced potatoes, tossed in Batali's red sauce with a hint of mint. Finally, chef Dan Silverman demonstrates how to remove pomegranate seeds from the fruit without too much hassle, and then add those seeds to an astonishing duck dish.Playful and dazzling desserts include meringue mushrooms, which look just like the real thing, and a Birch de Noel made of chocolate and cream, laid out like a Yuletide log. Household decorating hints are both clever and simple, including the strategic placing of colorful bowls of fruits and candies on shelves, and the embellishing of homemade wreaths with colorful balls (small, pink ones from Japan are oddly magical), candy, and popcorn. A section on Hanukkah gifts and foods includes a nice idea for filling embossed bags with candies, and a variation on traditional potato pancakes that includes adding strips of carrots and parsnips. Suggestions for making gifts and wrapping round out this very pleasant disc.--Tom Keogh</s>\", \"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.
